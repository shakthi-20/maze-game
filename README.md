A simple space-themed maze game created using Python's `turtle` module. The objective is to navigate the pointer (rocket) to the spaceman.

Ensure you have the following images saved in the project directory (space-maze-game):
  big.png (Background image)
  a1.gif (Spaceman image)
  r.gif (Rocket image)
  end.png (End screen image)

Use the arrow keys to move the rocket:
  Up Arrow: Move up
  Down Arrow: Move down
  Left Arrow: Move left
  Right Arrow: Move right
